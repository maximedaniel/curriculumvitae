# Configure working directory for knitr and here

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
require("knitr")

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = working_directory)

working_directory =  `r working_directory`.
file_path =  `r file_path`.
```{r ssa-logo, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "25%", fig.cap = "The new SSA logo, which is actually a scatterplot, which is super neat!"}

```

This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is a code chunk:

```{r}
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   <- coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```

The slope of the regression is `r b[1]`.
